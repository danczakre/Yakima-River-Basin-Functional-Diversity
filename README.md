# Functional diversity of riverine DOM is related to catchment size
Within this repository, we have the scripts and processed versions of the data necessary to replicate the analyses performed within the manuscript titled "Riverine organic matter functional diversity increases with catchment size". Below, you will find a brief description of each of the files:
- <b>RC2_Analysis_Final.R</b> is the key script for generating the results presented in the manuscript including calculating Rao's functional diversity. Notable exclusions in this script include: the transformation analysis and the metabolite/DOM dendrogram creation script which can both be found <a href="https://github.com/danczakre/Meta-Metabolome_Ecology">here</a>.
- <b>Data for Manuscript.zip</b> contains all of the specific files needed to replicate the results presented in the manuscript.
- <b>Still need to upload a few files</b> including 1) the CRAM dataset (compiled from Hertkorn et al., 2006) and 2) the bMTND_fast.R script required to calculate bMNTD using the Rfast package.
